# Data Analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn ðŸ“Š

This project demonstrates how to:
1. Load and clean a dataset.
2. Perform basic data analysis with Pandas.
3. Create beautiful data visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
4. Handle errors gracefully.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Load & Explore Dataset
- Dataset: **Iris dataset** from `sklearn`.
- Loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Checked data types and missing values.
- Cleaned dataset by dropping missing values (if any).

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Calculated descriptive statistics (`.describe()`).
- Grouped by species to calculate mean sepal length.
- Identified interesting patterns (e.g., petal length differs significantly across species).

### Task 3: Data Visualization
Created **four visualizations**:
1. **Line Chart** â†’ Cumulative mean of sepal length.
2. **Bar Chart** â†’ Average petal length by species.
3. **Histogram** â†’ Distribution of sepal width.
4. **Scatter Plot** â†’ Sepal length vs Petal length (colored by species).
